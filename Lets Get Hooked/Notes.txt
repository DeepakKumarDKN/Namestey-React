React uses somehing called reconciliation Algorithim which is also known as 
React Fibre

Suppose i have a container and in that container i have like 15 cards but i want to filter it by which 
i just want to filter 5 cards out of 15 cards

so first of all React creats a virtual dom for all those 15 cards. Remember one thing the virtual dom is 
not an Actual Dom.

Virtual Dom is a representation of Actual Dom.
Virtual Dom is nothing just an Javascript Object


Diff Algorithim 
----------------
It finds out the diffrence between two  dom the updated virtual dom and the previous dom (old virtual dom)
when i am filtering out something using logic we can call that as a new virtual dom  and the other one is old 
virtual dom

so i am filtering out something using an logic it will find out the diffrence between the two dom and it will
update the dom on every render cycle

This whole algorithim is known as react fibre which has come up in React 16, which is known as Reconciliation
A new algorithim came out to Update The Dom.

This is also known as React Fibre which finds out the diffrence between updated dom and the old dom and then it 
update the dom .

Suppose i want to change filter out 5 cards and that too when i will do it . when i will click on the button 
so as soon as i click on the button its creates a new object because preiously we are having 15 cards and now we are just 
having 5 cards so it will create a new object for the filtere objects and then it finfds out the diffrence between the two 
objects and then it actually update the DOM.
