React uses someting called reconcilliation Algorithim which is also known as React Fibre

Suppose i have a container and in that container i have like 15 cards but i want to filter it by which 
i just want to filter 5 cards out of 15 cards

so first of all React creats a virtual dom for all those 15 cards. Remember one thing the virtual dom is 
not an Actual Dom.

Virtual Dom is a representation of Actual Dom.
Virtual Dom is nothing just an Javascript Object


Diff Algorithim 
----------------
It finds out the diffrence between two  dom the updated virtual dom and the previous dom (old virtual dom)
when i am filtering out something using logic we can call that as a new virtual dom  and the other one is old 
virtual dom

so i am filtering out something using an logic it will find out the diffrence between the two dom and it will
update the dom on every render cycle

This whole algorithim is known as react fibre which has come up in React 16, which is known as Reconciliation
A new algorithim came out to Update The Dom.

This is also known as React Fibre which finds out the diffrence between updated dom and the old dom and then it 
update the dom .

Suppose i want to change filter out 5 cards and that too when i will do it . when i will click on the button 
so as soon as i click on the button its creates a new object because previously we are having 15 cards and now we are just 
having 5 cards so it will create a new object for the filtered objects and then it finds out the diffrence between the two 
objects and then it actually update the DOM.

React is doing Efficient DOM Manipulation and thats the reason it is Fast
Virtual Dom is Basically Those Tag and Elements.

Shimmer UI.
-----------
so a lttle amount if time is being taken to load the complete webpage upto that we can show a loading spinner 
or something else but is this a god way absolutely not this is not a good way. 

so now a days a concept is being used called SHIMMER UI. so this is the latest standard practises 
which is being used in industry. 

It is just like loading the Fake Page untill we get the actual data from Api so insted of shwing this 
Lading spinner we can show a fake page, a skeleton

Lets Take an example of Swiggy Home Page if we click on load the page. Mean while we return the complete webpage with actual data, 
swiggy is showing us the skeleton of that page with some fake cards and this was actually a mush use better expereince.


Two Ways of Exporting Data:
---------------------------
    - one is the default export 
    - named export 

example for default export 
--------------------------
    - in one file i can only have one default export. 
    - module cannot have multiple default export 

        export default fileOne  
        export default fileTwo     this is wrong we cannot do that module will not allow to do it for multiple times.
        export defaulr fileThree 
    
const Application = () => {
    return (
        <>
         <p>Hello</p>
        </>
    )
}

export default Application 

example for named export 
------------------------
    - named export is usually used when we want to do multiple export in a single file.
    - if we are using named export then we need to import that inside curly braces for example 
            import {export it here} from 'filename';
    - in this project i have used named export for mockData.js (resList) so how can i do that. 
            import { resList } from "../utils/mockData";

export const CARD_URL = "https://media-assets.swiggy.com/swiggy/image/upload/fl_lossy,f_auto,q_auto,w_660/"

useState
---------
let [listofResturants] = useState() is exacttly equal to 
let listofResturants;

React will keep my UI insink with Data Layer as soon as my Data Layer Update our UI will Update and how it is getting update 
by re-rendering so behind the scene what is happening is as soon as i will update my state variable React will re-render my 
component.

React is very Good at DOM Operation and thats is why React is very Fast. In this example as soon as i click on Top Resturant Button 
(State Variable) React will automatically change its component and it does it very Fast It keep my Data Layer in sink with the UI layar

React has Diff Algorithim which is very efficient it can do efficient DOM Manipulation in simple words it can do fast DOM Manipulation.
React is also fast because it contain Virtual Dom.



let [ListofResturants, setListofResturants] = useState(resList)
# This is actually called array destructuring.

const array = useState(resList)

let [ListofResturants, setListofResturants] = array

let ListofResturants = array[0] 
let setListofResturants = array[1]
