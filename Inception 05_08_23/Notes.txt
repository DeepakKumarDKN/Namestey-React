Emmet:
------
It basically genarate some code for us.

cdn:
----
content delivery networks, so cdn is the place where the react library is hoisted 
so we just fetching that into our code using CDN. 

cdn Link for React 
-------------------
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

we have two links one is react.development.js and the other one is
react-dom.development.js

from react.development.js we will get the React Code, the source code of React.
the 1st file is the core file of React.

and the second file known as react-dom.development.js and it will be useful for performing 
dom operations with the help of this file we can modify the react-dom (document object model)

Why there are two files.
-------------------------
There are two files because react doesnot only work on browsers it also work in mobile phones 
we have heard about react-native we can create interface for mobile using react-native.

so react is used in mobiles as well as in browsers and that is why there are two files.


creating an element in React 
----------------------------
React.createElement

const parent = React.createElement(
    'div',
    {id:'course_name'},
    React.createElement('h1', {}, 'Namestey React')
)

creating an element is a core thing of react so it comes from the react 
from the  1st file, core file.

But to render something inside it, or when we want to put something we have created
into our dom / browser for that we have to prefer ReactDOM, it is the job of ReactDOM.


ReactDom.createRoot() :- this commad will create a root. 

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(parent)




Notes:

About CDN:
----------
A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet
content, including HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.

Benefits Of Uisng CDN:
-------------------------
1. Improving Website Load Times.
2. Reducing Bandwith Costs.
3. Increasing Content Aailability and redudancy.
4. Improving Website Security.

Code Explanation 
----------------
const parent = React.createElement(
    'div',
    {id:'container'},
    [React.createElement('p',{id:'para_one'},'What is Lorem Ipsum?')],
    [React.createElement('p',{id:'para_one'},'Where does it come from?')],
    [React.createElement('p',{id:'para_one'},'Why do we use it?')],
    [React.createElement('p',{id:'para_one'},'Where can I get some?')]

)
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(parent)

// here parent is an object and that Object is the react element.
// React.createElement is creating an object
// and that object/element is being passed into render here it convert into HTML
// the render is finally responsible to convert it into HTML and put if off to the dom
// there will be only one root and one render method in an Application.
// ReactDOM is responsible for all DOM Operations.

The difference between upper one and the lower one is the lower one is the minified version.
and it is much more optimize for production use. the seie is also less as comapred to the upper one. 
but still we neer use cnd link in our code to build reaat app we haev to install react for that which 
we will learn later
