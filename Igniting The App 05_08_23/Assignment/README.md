### What is NPM ?
`NPM is something which manages our packages, it is the standard repositry for all the packages. NPM doesnot stand for Node Package Manager because no where in the documentation it is written that NPM Stands for node package manager but yes its works as a node package manager.`

### What is Parcel/Webpack and why do we need it ?
`Both Parcel and Webpack both are the Bundlers which bundels our App it packages our app perfectly so that it can be shipped to production both the bundlers do the same work. The Webpack is slower as compared to the Parcel.`<br/>

`We Need it because it does a lot of things for us behind the scenes  such as minifying, optimizing, bundling, host our file,it cleans our code etc etc. Parcel build's a server for us which support Hot Module Replacement that mean as soon as we do some changes in our code file it quickly do the changes rebilds it and send it to the browser `<br/>

`It is very Easy as Compared to the Webpack because it doesnot need configuration. Zero Configuration`
