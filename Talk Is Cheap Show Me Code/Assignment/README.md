## . Is JSX Manadatory For React
```
No it is not mandatory but if we will not write jsx our code will get too lengthy. If we are creating an element , 
the process of creating an element without JSX is very lengthy.

-{TitleComponent} : this is used to access variable inside the JSX 

-{<TitleComponent/>}: this is used to acess functional Component inside JSX. This is known as self closing Tag

- {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}: This is also used to access Functional Component Inside the JSX I will
