* Command to bring npm to our project : - npm init
* Command to bring npm to our project : - npm init
* Doing npm init will bring us package.json to our project
* There two type of dependency 
    normal dependency : 
    dev dependency : we need it in development phase/ development environment only.

* Browser List : This help us transform our code and make it compatible so that older version 
browser can understand it.

"browserslist" : [
    "Last 2 Chrome Versions"
]
this doesn't mean that it will work only on those two versions , this actually mean it will work on
other version but it will definitely work on last two versions of chrome.

* Babel converts the newer code to older code.
* Our modern Javascript (ES6) is converted into older Javascript and that is known as polyfill.
* we dont have to write polyfill babel does that for us.

*Tree Shaking mean removing unwanted code supoose we are using a library which have 5 function but 
i will use only 2 and rest of the 3 i dont want to use so what parcel will do it will ignore those 3
three functions.
command to run the project 
npx parcel index.html

* we dont have to write polyfill babel does that for us.

* JSX is not html inside the javascript jsx is html like syntax.

creating element using jsx
---------------------------
const heading = <h1 id= "heading">Hello Namestey React</h1>

How Does It Work Behing The scene 👓

- This JSX Code is transpiled/converted into React.createElement 
behind the scenes and the React.createElement is again converted into
JS Element or Js Object which is a ReactElement and at last it rendered 
into the DOM as an HTML Element.

- But who is doing this conversion , it is done by 💝 Babel 💝
when a JSX element is converted into React.createElement this conversion is made by Babel 🧡

- JSX => React.createElement => Js Element/Object => HTML(DOM)

creating element using React
----------------------------
const heading = React.createElement(
    "h1",
    {id:'title'}, 
    'Hello Namestey React'
)

so jsx seems to be easier than creating an element usng React. 😀

How yo give className in an JSX Element 💥
--------------------------------------------
const heading = <h1 id= "heading" className="heading">Hello Namestey React</h1>

// How to create an JSX 

const heading = (
    <>
        <h1>💙 Namestey React 💛</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Course Name: Namestey React</li>
            <li>Mentor Name: Akshay Saini</li>
            <li>Course Fee: 2100</li>

🧡 Two types Of Components in React 
    💥Class Based Component
    💥Functional Component

. Class Based Componet is the old way of writting code
. Functional based component is the new way of writting code 


💦Functional Component
------------------------
its just like an normal javascript function which always returns some javascript code.

. Name of functional component always starts with Capital Letter but it is not mandatory
it will work fine if we don't write it in capital letter but writting in capital letter 
is a good practise.

. Functional component is a normal function which return a peice a JSX element.

Syntax: 

const HeadingComponent = () =>{
    return(
        <>
            <h1>This is React Functional Component</h1>
        </>
    )
}

writting the same function without return
------------------------------------------
const HeadingComponent2 = () => (
    <h1>This is React Functional Component</h1>
)

🧡Important Note: 

    - I have written the functional component with return and without return 
    both are same.

Notes:🎇
-------
- React.createElement creates an object. 
- Babel is Javascript Compiler.
- Some older version browser don't understand the newer version es6 language 
    so here babel will convert the code so that the older version 
    browser also understand it.

- Babel is a javascript library which takes a peice of code 
reads that code and converts that code into something else, and 
it convert different type of code to different type of code.

- JSX is not HTML inside Javascript, but most of the people thinks that it is HTML inside Javascript
this is a HTML like syntax, its a fancy way of writting HTML

- 


- What is Component Composition 🧨
-----------------------------------
using another component inside a component lets get into an Example:
i will create here two functional component: - 
    1. Course Component 
    2. Heading Component

In this example iam using course component inside Heading Component this is known as component Composition

const CourseComponent = () =>(
    <>
        <h1>💙 Namestey React 💛</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Course Name: Namestey React</li>
            <li>Mentor Name: Akshay Saini</li>
            <li>Course Fee: 2100</li>
            <li> <a href="https://namastedev.com/namaste-react/">Website Link</a></li>
        </ul>
    </>
)

const HeadingComponent = () =>(
        <>
            <CourseComponent /> 🎈--- here i am using another component inside an component

            <h1 className = "functional_component">Functional Component 🧡</h1>
            <p>Look at the code file to see how functional Componet is written</p>

        </>
    )

root.render(<HeadingComponent />)
