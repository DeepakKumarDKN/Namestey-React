## What is JSX.?
```html
JSX mean Javascript XML, It is an HTML like syntax, its just an HTML like syntax, if we are using JSX and i want to 
create an h1 tag or an h2tag etc etc then there is no need of creating Element for that we can write it directly 
for example: 

const heading = <h1 id="headiing" className="heading">Namestey React</h1>

Look at the syntax JSX seems to be easier now like this we can create an element there is need of writing
is we are working with JSX

but if i will do the same thing without JSX then i have to write alot of code. lets see how i will write the same thing 
without JSX

const heading = React.createElement(
    "h1", 
    {id: "heading"},
    'Namestey React'
)

Note:
----
- JSX solve our readibility issue because the code written in JSX is much more easy as compared to the code 
whch are written without JSX.

- JSX was developed by Facebook Developers
- This is HTML Like syntax but this is not HTML

- JSX is not HTML inside Javascript, but most of the people thinks that it is HTML inside Javascript
this is a HTML like syntax


```

## Superpower of JSX .?
```
- JSX make our code looks elegant and simple.
- if we want to write a large peice of code then we should go for JSX.
- it prevents cross-side shifting effects.

## Coding Assignment
```
1. Create a Nested Header Element using React.createElement(h1,h2,h3 inside a di usin class title)

const createTag = React.createElement(
    'div',
    {className:'title'},
    [React.createElement('h1',{}, 'This is H1 Tag')],
    [React.createElement('h2',{}, 'This is H2 Tag')],
    [React.createElement('h3',{},'This is H3 Tag')],


) 
```
```
2.Create the Same Element Using JSX

const heading = (
    <div className = "title">
        <h1>This is h1 Tag 游눝</h1>
        <h2>This is h2 Tag 游비</h2>
        <h3>This is h3 Tag 游눛</h3>
    </div>
)
```
```
3. Create a functional component of the same with JSX
const Heading = () =>  {
    return (
    <div className = "title">
        <h1>This is h1 Tag 游눝</h1>
        <h2>This is h2 Tag 游비</h2>
        <h3>This is h3 Tag 游눛</h3>

        <h2 style = {{color : "red", fontFamily: "sans-serif"}}>This is h2 Tag 游비</h2>
        <h3 style= {{color : 'blue', fontFamily: "sans-serif"}}>This is h3 Tag 游눛</h3>
    </div>
    )
}
```
```
5. Composition Of Component (Add omponent inside another)

const CourseComponent = () =>(
    <>
        <h1>游눛 Namestey React 游눝</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Course Name: Namestey React</li>
            <li>Mentor Name: Akshay Saini</li>
            <li>Course Fee: 2100</li>
            <li> <a href="https://namastedev.com/namaste-react/">Website Link</a></li>
        </ul>
    </>
)

const Heading = () =>  {
    return (
    <div className = "title">
        <CourseComponent />
        <h1 style= {{color : 'black', fontFamily: "sans-serif"}}>This is h1 Tag 游눝</h1>
        <h2 style = {{color : "red", fontFamily: "sans-serif"}}>This is h2 Tag 游비</h2>
        <h3 style= {{color : 'blue', fontFamily: "sans-serif"}}>This is h3 Tag 游눛</h3>
    </div>
    )
}
