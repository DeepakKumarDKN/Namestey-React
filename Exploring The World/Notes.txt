Monolyth and microservice architecture.
---------------------------------------
So first of all all the apps were being developed using Monolyth Architecture and what does it actually mean is earlier we used to have a
big project and inside that project we used to have small peices of code 

    for API, 
    for Authentication, 
    we also have uio code inside the same project 
    we have database connectivity code inside the same project. 
    we also have notification code inside the same project.

so for example doing everything inside the same project.
and in that if i want to do soome changes jusy say to change the color of the button so for that 
we need to do a lot of work like deploying the whole big project, compiling the whole big project


But in todays time the world is moving towards Microsoft Architecture.
In Monolyth there is a single repositry and everybody used to work in that repositry 
but in Microservices it is diffrent that mean we have different services for different job 
and each of them work with their own independent service.

we have a backend service 
we have a ui service 
we have a authentication service 
we have a database service to maintain database 
we have a service for email notifcation 

and all these microservices doesn't have link with anyone 
in microservices everything is separate i mean its individual
i mean we have a separate backend serice, separate ui service
separate authentication service for each and everything small thing 
there is a diffrent project which is known as separation of concern

and it is also known as Single Responsibility Principle where each and every 
service has its own job

In monolyth if we are creating an application using Java then we have to do everything using Java
but in microservices architecture we can have UI written in React , we can have Backend written in Java
we can Have Authentication written in Python 

How do these services interact with each other 
-----------------------------------------------
So hows these services talk to each other i mean how the UI talk to Backend and 
how the backend talk to Database Service.

we can create microservices independently but how these are connected  
the wat react is running on a specefic port similarly all thee services 
can run on their own specefic port suppose on 

    port 1234 : ui services 
    port 2345 : authentication services 
    port 6789 : backend services
    port 3000 : email services

and they interact with each other through UI Calls.
