Hook is nothing just a normal Javascript Function which is being given to us by React
and it has its own specefic usecase. 

useState is used to create state variable.

useEffect: to use this one we have to import it just like we imported useState.
useEffect takes two arguments 
    1. arrow function which is a callback function 
    2. dependency array 
    
    useEffect(()=> {}, [])

So now the question is when we will call useEffect. we can call useEffect after the component render.
so when we will write this one inside the component first after the component rendering is over as soon 
as the redndering gets completed it will just quickly call the callback function(useEffect)

Example:
-------
const body () => {
    return (
        <h1>Hello </h1>
        useEffect(()=> {},[])
        <h2>Hello Again
    )
}

look at this peice of code first of all the component will render first that mean hello will be printed first 
then when it wil come to line number 22 it will tell just wait let the component rendering gets over and then we will execute 
so first hello will get printed then hello again will get printed and at last useEffect will get called so this is how the 
useEffect gets executed. 

it will execute at the end after the component execution gets over the useEffect will get called.



useEffect is just like a nomal function and we will call this function with a callback and 

Monolyth and microservice architecture.
---------------------------------------
So first of all all the apps were being developed using Monolyth Architecture and what does it actually mean is earlier we used to have a
big project and inside that project we used to have small peices of code 

    for API, 
    for Authentication, 
    we also have ui code inside the same project 
    we have database connectivity code inside the same project. 
    we also have notification code inside the same project.

so for example doing everything inside the same project.
and in that if i want to do soome changes just say to change the color of the button so for that 
we need to do a lot of work like deploying the whole big project, compiling the whole big project


But in todays time the world is moving towards Microsoft Architecture.
In Monolyth there is a single repositry and everybody used to work in that repositry 
but in Microservices it is diffrent that mean we have different services for different job 
and each of them work with their own independent service.



we have a backend service 
we have a ui service 
we have a authentication service 
we have a database service to maintain database 
we have a service for email notifcation 

all these are small serices and it combine together to form a big app

and all these microservices doesn't have link with anyone 
in microservices everything is separate i mean its individual
i mean we have a separate backend serice, separate ui service
separate authentication service for each and everything small thing 
there is a diffrent project which is known as separation of concern

and it is also known as Single Responsibility Principle where each and every 
service has its own job nobody is interfearing with it.

In monolyth if we are creating an application using Java then we have to do everything using Java
but in microservices architecture we can have UI written in React , we can have Backend written in Java
we can Have Authentication written in Python 

How do these services interact with each other 
-----------------------------------------------
So hows these services talk to each other to make the whole application work 
i mean how the UI talk to Backend and how the backend talk to Database Service, 
how the backend serice needs to talk to the Auth.

we can create microservices independently but how these are connected  
the wat react is running on a specefic port similarly all thee services 
can run on their own specefic port suppose on 

    port 1234 : ui services 
    port 2345 : authentication services 
    port 6789 : backend services
    port 3000 : email services

and they interact with each other through UI Calls.
on diffrent ports we can deploy diffrent service.

How we can Fetch Data Dynamically From The Api. 
-----------------------------------------------
So there are Two Ways to Do it 

    1. Load ----- Api ---- Render
    # as soon as the page load we can make an API Call wait for the data to come and then we can render the UI.
    # we have seen it alot of time. take the example of swiggy website here as soon as in enter the webpage
    # fraction of seconds i cannot see any thing but as soon as the API Respong it quickly render out eerything.

    2. Load ----- Render --- Api --- Render
    # as soon as the page load we will render it, as soon as we render i we will make an API Call after getting the 
    # result back from API we will render our aplication once again with the data from the UI

as we know there are two ways to fetch data the second approach will be helpful while working with 
useEffect.

if we want to do something after rendering the component so we hae to 
write it inside the useEffect.
FetchData 
---------
Fetch is a super function which is given to us by browsers, its a super power which JS Engine have
fetch will fetch data from the API 


Note:
----
I want to change the state variable using setbtnName from Login to Logout.

const [btnName, setbtnName] = useState('Login')


so Whenever the state variable will change using setbtnName react will re render the component
and all the values will get updated .. so basically it is refreshing the component, here it is 
triggering the reconcillation fibre.

rendering a component mean calling a component.

here i am modifying a constant variable as per the rules of he javascript if we are declare using 
const then we cannot do the modification but here we can do it because when we are using setbtnName
to do the UI Updation React is basically updating the btnName value by calling the component once again 
so it is basically calling the component but this time btnName is the new variable then it was before.
