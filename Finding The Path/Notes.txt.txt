useEffect 
---------
we have to import useEffect just like we import useState if we want to use it.
import {useEffect} from  "react";

useEffect always takes two arguments:
    1. callback function 
    2. array dependency

useEffect(()=> {},[])

when is useEffect is called:
----------------------------
useEffect is callled everythime my component render.
callback function is mandatory inside the useEffect but 
array dependency is not mandatory.

- if no dependency arrayuseEffect is called on every render.
- if there is an empty dependency [] : useEffect will be called only on initial rendering(just once)
when the  component will render fopr thr first time.

- if there is a dependency array for example (here i am pointing out to btnReact as a dependency aray) 
everytime when useEffect willðŸŽ“ btnReact will get updated.

useEffect(()=> {
    console.log('use effect called)
},[btnReact])
